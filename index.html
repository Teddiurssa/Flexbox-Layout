        <header>Hi. I'm Melissa.</header>
        <main>A Pharmacy Technician that's on a journey to become a Web Developer. I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, Flexbox, Git, GitHub, or whatever comes my way. I am always up for a challenge and I love learning new things. I also work on graphic design projects that specialize in logo design, labelling, and branding</main>

            I was born in the small city of Kamloops, BC. In my early twenties, I left for the greater Vancouver area and haven't wanted to return. As of now, I live in beautiful South Surrey. Being close to the sunny White Rock beach is a real treat that I really should visit more often.

            My Passion: I'm all about organizing and planning my day. Planning out my day has become a daily habit that I keep on top of constantly to keep myself efficient in learning new skills and getting through daily tasks. I love doing things on my computer whether it's coding, gaming, and creating digital art.

            A Fun Fact: I love to read. In my spare time, I'm usually reading a book. I am a big fan of fantasy stories at the moment. Currently, I am reading Robin Hobb and loving The Realm of the Elderlings series. I have a guilty pleasure of reading VC Andrew novels, I'm a huge fan of her work and own all her books.
